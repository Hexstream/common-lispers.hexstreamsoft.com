        <p>Only <strong>persons</strong> will be added to the list. This excludes teams, companies, organizations, etc. Of course, individual members of such groups may be eligible.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for inclusion in the list, the candidate must have contributed something (<em>anything</em>) to the open-source Common Lisp ecosystem and have some kind of Common Lisp related web presence that they personally control.<sup><a href="#footnote_deceased-persons" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
        <p>Proprietary contributions have no weight, since they cannot easily be reviewed by everyone.</p>
        <p>Please <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> if any eligible persons have not yet been added to the list, whether that is you or someone else.</p>
        <p>Please note that nobody has received, nor will receive, any type of notification as a direct result of them getting added to the list, as that could certainly be seen as "spamming" or otherwise undesirable.<sup><a href="#footnote_self-add-request-notification" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

        <p>To help ensure that the list is as comprehensive as possible, and to avoid politicizing the list, and to avoid dividing the community, and to avoid contentious discussions about who should or should not be included, nobody will be excluded from the list on the basis of alleged or actual reprehensible behavior.</p>
        <p>This implies that inclusion in the list merely documents existence, and does not in any way imply affiliation or endorsement. One may simply <a href="../preferences/#block" target="_blank">block</a> people they don't want to see.</p>
        <p>Additionally, nobody will be excluded from the list on the basis of: age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.<sup><a href="#footnote_no-discrimination-contributor-covenant" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

        <p>The list is composed of entries. Each entry describes one person, and is composed of the following fields, which must all be composed of links only (for ensuring a minimum of concreteness and verifiability):</p>

        <ol>

          <li id="structure-of-an-entry_full-name">
            <p>The <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_full-name"><dfn>Full name</dfn></a> field is the person's full name as it is publicly disclosed by the person themselves to the Common Lisp community, and as is generally known to the Common Lisp community. This does not usually include any middle name, unless that person very consistently uses their middle name everywhere or unless an ambiguity would otherwise arise. If the full name is not publicly known, then just a nickname is fine.</p>
          </li>

          <li id="structure-of-an-entry_nickname">
            <p>The <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_nickname"><dfn>Nickname</dfn></a> field is the person's informal name as generally known within the Common Lisp community.</p>
            <p>When a person is first added to the list, they may or may not be auto-assigned a nickname or linkable nickname, depending on the level of certainty or lack thereof about their preferred nickname in a Common Lisp context. Generally, a linkable nickname will be auto-assigned if at least 2 of their accounts have the same nickname, or substantially the same nickname when accounting for avoidance of nickname collisions among other users on the same service.</p>
            <p>Linkable nicknames are auto-assigned only when certainty is high, as changing a linkable nickname breaks all links referring to that nickname. Unlinkable nicknames are much less prejudicious if incorrect, since changing them breaks no links.</p>
            <p>List members with no nickname or an unlinkable nickname are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> stating their preferred nickname, and they will then be assigned that linkable nickname. So as to avoid confusion and preserve the list's integrity, they must have a history of using that nickname in a Common Lisp context.</p>
          </li>

          <li id="structure-of-an-entry_website-or-blog">
            <p>The <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_website-or-blog"><dfn>Website or Blog</dfn></a> field is the most general entry point to that person's website or blog that is specifically about open-source Common Lisp.</p>
            <p>The label for this field must be <code>Website</code> or <code>Blog</code>. The name of the website or blog itself is never used as label, due to fairness concerns. This way, websites or blogs with better or longer names don't get an advantage, and we avoid bloating up the list and getting a lot of variation in Website or Blog label length.</p>
            <p>If the blog supports a tag filtering option and a tag <code>common-lisp</code>, then the link must point to that tag. Else, if the <code>lisp</code> tag is supported, then that tag must be used. This applies even if most or all of the blog's posts use these tags anyway. This is to ensure that the link remains focused on Common Lisp even if multiple posts unrelated to Common Lisp are added in the future. If the link points to one of these tags rather than the blog itself, then this is reflected in the label with a mention such as <i class="hint">(lisp tag)</i>.</p>
            <p>On occasion, a common-lisp or lisp tag may be ignored if it is believed that the tag is broken in some way, such as if posts are not consistently appropriately tagged.</p>
          </li>

          <li id="structure-of-an-entry_social-media-accounts">
            <p>The <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_social-media-accounts"><dfn>Social media accounts</dfn></a> fields describe <em>personal</em> social media accounts of that person. Accounts controlled by more than one person are not eligible.</p>
            <p>For now, social media account information does not have to have anything to do with Common Lisp. This is due to the relative difficulty of formulating policies regarding what counts as sufficiently or insufficiently Common Lisp related activity on these accounts. However, any entries in the Funding category must have something to do with open-source programming. Some not very Common Lisp related social media accounts may be moved to the <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_addenda">Addenda</a> section in the future.</p>
          </li>

          <li id="structure-of-an-entry_highlights">
            <p>The <a href="#structure-of-an-entry_highlights"><dfn>Highlights</dfn></a> field highlights up to 2 of that person's most notable open-source Common Lisp related accomplishments.</p>
            <p>This field is limited to 2 items. This confers several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>We avoid devolving into a laundry list of accomplishments that would bloat up the list.<br />For many people, only one or two of their contributions really stand out compared to their other ones anyway, so listing any further would confer diminishing returns, thereby lowering the overall quality of the list.<br />It is up to the individual list members to properly organize their Common Lisp web presence (that the list conveniently points to) to properly feature their further contributions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We avoid thorny questions about the relative notability of accomplishments, and also avoid large variations in the number of items, whether fair or unfair. Furthermore, list members for which the best contributions were incorrectly identified are less penalized than otherwise, relative to list members for which the best contributions were perfectly well identified.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We create a more welcoming environment for beginners, who might otherwise be intimidated with the prospect of being included in a list where many people have a long list of several notable accomplishments when they themselves have only one or two contributions to offer. We also avoid digging up several barely usable contributions from less experienced contributors.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We incite more casual users of the list to review the contributions of more persons overall, since there are less contributions to review per person.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The list is more stable, which means those who track its changes (such as by "watching" <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com" target="_blank">the repo on GitHub</a>) experience a better signal to noise ratio.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Books for which the full text is not freely legally available online (without any access restrictions such as a "loginwall") are not eligible, since their contents cannot be readily reviewed by everyone.</p>

            <p>List members who believe their best contributions have not been correctly identified are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> to rectify the situation.</p>
            <p>Due to various factors, some list members may have been auto-assigned less than 2 highlights, in which case they are encouraged to submit further contributions to better take advantage of the 2 slots they are entitled to. For instance, if one particular contribution is believed to completely dwarf that list member's other contributions, then only that contribution may be auto-assigned, but said list member is then encouraged to submit another contribution that they wish to promote.</p>
            <p>Rarely, some list members may not be auto-assigned any highlights if the editor is particularly confused about which of their contributions are the most notable. This might arise for example if the contributions are vastly outside the fields of expertise or interest of the editor, or if many of said contributions are in a foreign language. So-afflicted list members are greatly encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/Hexstream/common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/issues" target="_blank">submit their best contributions</a> to rectify the situation.</p>
